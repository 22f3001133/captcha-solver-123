# Captcha Solver Demo This project provides a simple, single-file HTML application demonstrating a basic client-side captcha "solver" interface, primarily designed to validate against a specific hardcoded captcha for the included `sample.png` image. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface. ## Features *   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent look and feel across various device sizes. *   **Dynamic Image Loading:** Displays a captcha image. By default, it uses `sample.png`. *   **URL Parameter Support:** Allows loading custom captcha images via a URL query parameter (`?url=`). *   **Client-Side Validation (for `sample.png`):** Provides feedback for the hardcoded solution of `sample.png` ("ADUR3"). *   **Submission Handling (for external images):** For images loaded via URL, it simulates submission, acknowledging that actual captcha solving would require a backend. ## Usage 1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 2.  **Solve the Captcha:** *   **Default:** The `sample.png` image will be displayed. Enter "ADUR3" into the input field and click "Solve Captcha" or press Enter. *   **Custom Image URL:** To test with a different image, append the `?url=` parameter to your `index.html` file path. For example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/some-captcha-image.png` *   *Note:* Client-side validation is only implemented for `sample.png`. For external images, the app will simply acknowledge the submission. ## Technologies Used *   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page. *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness. (Loaded via CDN) *   **JavaScript:** For dynamic content, image loading logic, and client-side captcha validation. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
